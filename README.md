Order-Placement-JSP-script
==========================

A script to place order via mail 


Well this is a simple JSP script to automate the process of order mail generation
for any business owner.

This script is part of a much larger project(see case_study.pdf),
but it will work with any aplication using Sql database and make life easy.  

It can be costomised to be used with existing tables ... or the default table structures are in case_study.pdf.

Just install the apache tomcat (I have plans to port it to PHP, if I get time )...
Type in your sql credentials .. 
Type in your gmail credentials(You can make it use any e-mail service as long as you know what you are doing)..
customise the table and that's it.


enjoy !!! 

I beleve in making life easy.
